Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model for Medical Images Generation

The scarcity of accessible medical image data poses a significant obstacle in effectively training deep learning models for medical diagnosis, as hospitals refrain from sharing their data due to privacy concerns. In response, we gathered a diverse dataset named MedImgs, which comprises over 250,127 images spanning 61 disease types and 159 classes of both humans and animals from open-source repositories. We propose a Leapfrog Latent Consistency Model (LLCM) that is distilled from a retrained diffusion model based on the collected MedImgs dataset, which enables our model to generate real-time high-resolution images.
